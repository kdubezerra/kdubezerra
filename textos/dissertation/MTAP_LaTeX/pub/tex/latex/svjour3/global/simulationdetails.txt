each player interacts in the same way, i.e. it's avatar has the same area of interest, and the same level of influence on the avatars around his avatar

the area of interest of a player is limited to its cell, and its cell's neighbors (mixed IM -> per cell, then per player {n√£o citar [6] do lu2006lbm? mto velho?})

there is a tolerance for disbalance, avoiding constant disbalancing (perhaps I should hide this)

future work: perform a lower level simulation, considering all traffic between servers and clients, including migration packets, message aggregation when sending state updates to a player etc.
