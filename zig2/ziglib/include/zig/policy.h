/*! \brief A collection of parameters for streams.

		When a new stream is created on an existing ZIG connection it takes a collection of parameters which determine 
		some of the details of how the stream will work. The parameters are as follows:

		- Send interval: The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that should elapse before sending the stream payload 
		on a new outgoing packet. Example: 
			- Suppose the send interval for a given stream S is configured to 0.1s;
			- A ZIG UDP packet is sent with the payload of stream S (for instance, a collection of messages being sent 
			or re-sent through stream S);
			- 0.05s of real time elapses (less than 0.1s);
			- A new ZIG UDP packet is sent. Since the last packet was sent less than 0.1s ago, this packet won't contain 
			message retransmissons for stream S.

		- Resend interval: The minimum amount of time, in seconds, that should elapse before re-sending a message 
		through a stream of type STREAM_INDIVIDUAL_ACK (streams of type STREAM_CUMULATIVE_ACK always resend messages 
		on every outgoing packet). Example:
			- Suppose the resend interval for a given stream S is configured to 0.4s;
			- The local application requests that message M is sent through stream S;
			- A ZIG UDP packet is sent with the payload of stream S, which contains message M;
			- 0.2s of real time elapses (less than 0.4s);
			- A new ZIG UDP packet is sent with the payload of stream S. The receipt of message M is still not acknowledged 
			by the remote host, but since the resend interval has not elapsed yet (0.4s), message M is not re-sent in this 
			outgoing packet.

		- Max outgoing flow: The maximum amount of bytes that the stream may insert on the outgoing UDP packet.

		- Discard unsent unreliables: A boolean flag for the stream. Default is "false", which keeps this new 
		tool disabled. When this parameter set to "true" on a stream of type STREAM_NO_ACK, it causes ALL of the 
		pending outgoing messages list to be WIPED OUT CLEAN, EVERY TIME A PACKET IS SENT. When this is set to 
		"true" on a stream of type STREAM_CUMULATIVE_ACK, it causes all pending outgoing messages that are marked 
		with "unreliable" delivery to be WIPED OUT, EVERY TIME A PACKET IS SENT (messages marked as "reliable" 
		delivery are not affected). NOTE: A message's "unreliable" or "reliable" delivery status is controlled 
		by the bool argument of either zigclient_c::send_message() or zigserver_c::send_message()). If you don't 
		know what you are doing, leave this flag set to false. This is a helper for some applications so they can 
		better implement their flow/bandwidth control schemes.

		\see zigclient_c and zigserver_c for an explanation of streams and connections
