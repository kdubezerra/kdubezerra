This file is *NOT* automatically read by the library when sending or receiving messages!
It is just a reminder of how they work and a description of their fields.

CommandMessage:

int[0] = TYPE

bool[0] = HAS_CONTENT
bool[1] = KNOWS_TARGETS
bool[2] = HAS_PRIOR_STATES
bool[3] = KNOWS_SERVERS
bool[4] = IS_OPTIMISTICALLY_DELIVERABLE
bool[5] = IS_CONSERVATIVELY_DELIVERABLE

Message[?1] = COMMAND_CONTENT (application level stuff), IF has contents
Message[?2] = OBJECT_INFO_LIST, IF knows targets
Message[?3] = PRIOR_STATE_LIST, IF has prior_states
Message[?4] = SERVER_LIST, IF knows servers
