/*! \brief Checks if a given IP address is a 'private' address.

		The text below is from Wikipedia ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#Private_networks ): 

		"Of the 4 billion addresses allowed in IPv4, four ranges of address are reserved for private networking use only. 
		These ranges are not routable outside of private networks, and private machines cannot directly communicate with 
		public networks. They can, however, do so through network address translation.

<PRE>
The following are the four ranges reserved for private networks:
Name          IP address range              number of IPs  classful description     largest CIDR block
24-bit block  10.0.0.0  10.255.255.255     16,777,216     single class A           10.0.0.0/8
20-bit block  172.16.0.0  172.31.255.255   1,048,576      16 contiguous class Bs   172.16.0.0/12
16-bit block  192.168.0.0  192.168.255.255 65,536         256 contiguous class Cs  192.168.0.0/16
16-bit block  169.254.0.0  169.254.255.255 65,536         256 contiguous class Cs  169.254.0.0/16
</PRE>

		In addition to private networking, the IP range 127.0.0.0  127.255.255.255 (or 127.0.0.0/8 in CIDR notation) 
		is reserved for localhost communication. Any address within this range should never appear on an actual network 
		and any packet sent to this address does not leave the source computer, and will appear as an incoming packet on 
		that computer (known as Loopback)."

		If the IP address provided as argument to this function falls in any of the categories above, this function 
		returns \c true. Otherwise, this function returns \c false.

		\param address The IP address you want to check, in string form and in IP dot notation ("X.X.X.X"). For instance, 
		"143.54.12.74" or "10.0.0.2".

/*! \brief String tokenizer. On a given string, returns the next sequence of characters which is delimited by a 
		pair of whitespace and tab characters at both ends or, optionally, by a pair of double-quotes (ASCII 34).

		This function can be used to tokenize a null-terminated string, by breaking it into sequences of chars that 
		are separated by sequences of spaces and tabs at both ends. For instance, if you have the following string:
		<TT>/connect 127.0.0.1</TT> which is a command-line on your game console or a line read from a script, you 
		would probably like to break it up in <TT>/connect</TT> and in <TT>127.0.0.1</TT>, so that you can interpret 
		it as being a command ("connect to a server") and its argument (the IP address of the target server).

		However, each call to getcmd() can extract only one token. So, a getcmd() call must be placed in a loop or 
		in a chain of "if" statements. The \c cmd argument is a pointer to a char pointer that you have. The char pointer, 
		initially, should point to the beginning (first char) of the whole command string. After a call to getcmd(), 
		considering the example above, the char pointer will be modified by getcmd() to point to the first char of the 
		second token, which happens to be the first char after the whitespace which signals the end of the first token.
		The pointer to the modified char pointer is then supplied again as argument to getcmd(), which will start parsing 
		the input string from that position instead of the beginning, and thus now returning the next token on the sequence,
		which on the example above is <TT>127.0.0.1</TT>. 
		
		To extract all tokens, getcmd() should be called until it returns zero or a negative value, which means that there 
		are no more tokens to read.

    \param cmd A pointer, to a pointer which points to one of the chars of a null-terminated string. The 
		actual char being pointed at is the current position of the string tokenizer;
		\param buf A writable buffer that will receive the next token, which is extracted from \c cmd by a call to 
		this function;
		\param doubleQuote Whether double quotes should indicate a single token, overriding the whitespace separator:
		- \c true to recognize "this is a token" as a single token/substring/command:  ("this is a token")
		- \c false to recognize "this is a token" as the following set of four tokens:  ("this) (is) (a) (token")

		\return Result of the operation:
		- A positive value (greater than zero): Next token read OK, token is returned through \c buf;
		- \c 0 (zero): String is empty, no more tokens to read from the input string;
		- \c -1: Syntax error (end of string reached while looking for an enclosing double-quote (") char.
