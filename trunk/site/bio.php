<p style="text-align:justify">I was born the may 17th, 1985, in Maranguape, a city in the countryside of the state of Ceará, in the northeast region of Brazil. However, I grew up in Feira de Santana, in Bahia, and stayed there until 2002, when I was sixteen and moved once again, this time do Salvador, capital of Bahia.<br /><br />

In Salvador, I entered college, eventually graduating and earning the title of Bachelor in Computer Science, in february 2007, from the Federal University of Bahia. After finishing my undergraduate course, I applied for some post-graduation programs from universities all over Brazil, which were: UFPE, UFBA, UNICAMP, UFRGS and USP.<br /><br />

It makes me proud to say that I have been accepted in most of them - I had some problems with the documentation sent to UFPE - and I chose the one I think is the major and best post-graduation program in Computer Science in Brazil: UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul), in the southernmost (and coldest) state of the country, where I ended up obtaining my master's degree, in march 2009.<br><br>

Right after that, I applied for a PhD student position in UFRGS, and now I am pursuing the PhD title. Also, as I met Prof. Dr. Fernando Pedone, during my first year as a PhD student in UFRGS I applied for a scholarship from the Swiss Confederation, which was granted to me and made it possible to come to Lugano, Switzerland, where I am living now, since September 2010. I am also enrolled in USI (Universittà della Svizzera italiana) as a PhD student, now with double supervision, by Prof. Cláudio Geyer, in Brazil, and Prof. Fernando Pedone, in Switzerland.</p>
