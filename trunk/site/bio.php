I was born the may 17h, 1985, in Maranguape, a city in the countryside of the state of Cear√°, in the northeast region of Brazil. However, I grew up in Feira de Santana, in Bahia, and stayed there until 2002, when I was sixteen and moved once again, this time do Salvador, capital of Bahia.<br /><br />

In Salvador, I entered college, eventually graduating and earning the title of Bachelor in Computer Science, in february 2007, from the Federal University of Bahia. After finishing my undergraduate course, I applied for some post-graduation programs from universities all over Brazil, which were: UFPE, UFBA, UNICAMP, UFRGS and USP.<br /><br />

It makes me proud to say that I have been accepted in most of them - I had some problems with the documentation sent to UFPE - and I chose the one I think is the major and best post-graduation program in Computer Science in Brazil: UFRGS (Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul), in the southest (and coldest) region of the country, where I live by now.<br /><br />

After obtaining my master's degree, by march 2009, I applied for a PhD student position in UFRGS, and now I am pursuing the PhD title.
